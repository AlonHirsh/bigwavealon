        <h2 class="red big_font"><i> What is big wave surfing?</i></h2>
        <div id="specialstyle">Big wave surfing is a discipline within surfing in which experienced surfers paddle into, or are towed into,
        waves which are at least 20 feet (6.2 m) high, on surf boards known as "guns" or towboards.
        Sizes of the board needed to successfully surf these waves vary by the size of the wave as well as the technique the surfer uses to reach the wave.
        A larger, longer board allows a rider to paddle fast enough to catch the wave and has the advantage of being more stable, but it also limits maneuverability and surfing speed.

            For it to be considered big wave surfing, a surfer must tackle a wave <br />of at least 20 feet (6.2 metres) high.
            Speeds of around 80km/h (50mph) are common, and wipeouts will see bodies skip along the water’s surface,
            like pebbles skimmed on a lake. Many lives have been taken in the process, but big wave surfing has only surged
            in popularity and in our manual to XXL surfing, we reveal the smaller elements of riding the bigger waves.

        and Hawaii will reel in most, but so many other spots are being put on the world’s XXL surf map.
